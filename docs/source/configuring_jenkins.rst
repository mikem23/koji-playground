Unit tests in Fedora's Jenkins
==============================

We're using Fedora's `Jenkins <https://jenkins.fedorainfracloud.org/job/koji>`_
infrastructure for automatically running unit tests for new commits in
master branch.

Current setup uses periodical checking of koji's git and when new commits are
seen, tests are run. Normal developer needn't to care about his workflow, but can
use it for his advantage as it can run tests for him with platforms he has no
access to. Currently are tests run on Fedora 24, Fedora 25 and CentOS 6
platforms.

Usage
-----

If you need any change in jenkins setup, please file a pagure issue. As part
of solving issue, this documentation must be updated to reflect current state
in jenkins.

If you want to run tests against specific repo (your or official branch), log
in to jenkins (via FAS unified login), navigate to `Build with parameters
<https://jenkins.fedorainfracloud.org/job/koji/build?delay=0sec>`_ and put
your repository url to ``REPO`` and name of branch to ``BRANCH``.
``BRANCH_TO`` could be left blank as it is default set to *master*. Pressing
``BUILD`` should give you link to running build in all supported
environments.


Configuration
-------------

- Public access is for everyone with no need to log in to jenkins.
- Admin access is via same interface and currently tkopecek and mikem have
   access there. If you need access for yourself (you're probably part of
   brew/koji team) create jira in BREW project requesting this.
   Prerequisite for this is Fedora account (probably same one you are using
   for work in pagure).

- Setup - Following items are set-up via
   https://jenkins.fedorainfracloud.org/job/koji/configure

- Please don't change access rules (*Enable project-based security*
   fields) unless you've a corresponding jira for that, so every change of
   access is tracked there.
- *Job notifications* - when jenkins job finishes, it will send some info to
   pagure. Such call will add a comment to PR. For this REST hook needs to
   be configured:

   * Format: JSON
   * Protocol: HTTP
   * Event: Job Finalized
   * URL: <url taken from koji pagure settings which will look similar to https://pagure.io/api/0/ci/jenkins//koji/<hash>/build-finished
   * Timeout: 30000
   * Log: 0

- *This build is parametrized* (checkbox set to true) - it allows jenkins
   to use other branches than master (especially for PRs). Three parameters
   are defined there:

   * REPO - The repository for the pull request.
   * BRANCH - The branch for the pull request.
   * BRANCH_TO - A branch into which the pull request should be merged.

- *Discard Old Builds*

   * Strategy: Rotation
   * Days to keep build: 20
   * Max # of builds to keep: empty

- *Disable build* - it could be used if a lot of failing build happens with
    no vision of early recovery - temporarily suspend jenkins jobs
- *Execute concurrent builds if necessary* - We currently have no need of this
- *Restrict where this project can be run* - Fedora 24 is used for now which means 'F24' value
- *Source Code Management*

  * Git
  * Repositories

    * Repository URL: https://pagure.io/koji.git
    * Credentials: none
    * Branches to build: origin/master

- *Build triggers*

  * *Trigger builds remotely*: true

    * Authentication tokens: <token from koji pagure settings>

  * *Poll SCM*:

    * Schedule: H/5 * * * *

- *Build* - most important part - script which runs tests itself. Here you can also add missing requirements which will get installed via pip (not via rpms from F24!)

- *Post-build actions*

  * *Publish Cobertura Coverage report*: coverage.xml - this will create coverage report accessible via jenkins web ui
  * *E-mail notification*:

    * Recipients: tkopecek@redhat.com brew-devel@redhat.com
    * Send separate e-mails to individuals who broke the build

- *Send messages to fedmsg*
