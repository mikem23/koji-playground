Migrating to Koji 1.22
======================

You should consider the following changes when migrating to 1.22:

DB Updates
----------

There are two minor schema changes in this release.

* we've updated all ``timestamp`` fields to ``timestamptz`` with the return value of
  ``get_event_time()`` function to avoid unexpected time offset caused by PostgreSQL timezone
  setting (`PR#2237 <https://pagure.io/koji/pull-request/2237>`_).
* we've updated the ``sessions_active_and_recent`` index for the ``session`` table for better
  performance (`PR#2334 <https://pagure.io/koji/pull-request/2334>`_)

As in previous releases, we provide a migration script that updates the database.

Dropped python2 support of hub and web
--------------------------------------

Python 2 was `sunset <https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/>`_ on January 1, 2020.
Starting with Koji 1.22, hub and web will only support Python 3.
The CLI, builder, and utils retain Python 2 support for now.
For more information see: `PR#2218 <https://pagure.io/koji/pull-request/2218>`_

.. _migration_krbv:

Dropped krbV authentication support
-----------------------------------

We have dropped all the code related to the old python-krbV library, and are now only
providing GSSAPI auth.
For ``ClientSession`` objects, ``krb_login()`` is redirected to
``gssapi_login()`` with a printed warning.
Any code still calling ``krb_login()`` directly should be updated.

The newer gssapi authentication mechanism requires either ``python-requests-kerberos`` or
``python-requests-gssapi``.

For more information see: `PR#2244 <https://pagure.io/koji/pull-request/2244>`_ and
`PR#2280 <https://pagure.io/koji/pull-request/2280>`_


Other changes
-------------

There are numerous other changes in 1.22 that should not have a direct impact on migration. For
details see: :doc:`../release_notes/release_notes_1.22`
